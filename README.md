# MSB_Non-Stationarity

Code behind all figures and examples used in Rollinson et al. manuscript on nonstationarity (space- & time-varying trends) in prep for Macrosystems Biology special issue of Frontiers in Ecology & the Environment.

There will be at least 3 things in here:
1. Code for conceptual figures using synthetic data
2. Data & code for breeding bird example (spatial nonstationarity)
3. Data & code for tree ring example (temporal nonstationarity)
